title: Virtual KVM CPUFreq

description: |

  KVM CPUFreq is a virtualized driver in guest kernels that sends utilization
  of its vCPUs as a hint to the host. The host uses hint to schedule vCPU
  threads and select CPU frequency. It enables accurate Per-Entity Load
  Tracking for tasks running in the guest by querying host CPU frequency
  unless a virtualized FIE exists(Like AMUs).
